# Pizzaiolo Server

A simple server to provide data over REST to the Pizzaiolo app. Built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Restify](http://restify.com/), using some static JSON files as data.

## Installation

If you're planning to test the Pizzaiolo app, you'll need to have the server running. It's as simple as typing these 3 commands.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone [repo-name-placeholder]
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
$ cd path/to/project
$ npm install
```

3. Run the server via `$ node index.js` or `$ npm start`. Even better, install [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and in addition to starting the server, it will monitor file changes and restart automatically.

The "Pizzaiolo" name is a made up name for this specific project. It doesn't refer to any existing brand or company.
